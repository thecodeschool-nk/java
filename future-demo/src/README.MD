## Java Future Demo
The Future interface in Java represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It allows you to check the status of a task, cancel it, and retrieve the result once it completes. Future is typically used in conjunction with an ExecutorService to handle asynchronous tasks in concurrent programming.

### Key Methods in Future:
get(): Blocks the calling thread until the task completes, and returns the result.
cancel(): Attempts to cancel the execution of the task.
isDone(): Checks if the task has completed.
isCancelled(): Checks if the task was canceled before completion.
get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit): Waits for the task to complete within the given timeout.
In this demo, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to submit tasks using an ExecutorService and work with Future to get the result of the computation.
