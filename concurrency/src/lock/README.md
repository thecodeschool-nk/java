## Lock
In Java, the Lock interface is part of the java.util.concurrent.locks package and provides a more flexible mechanism for thread synchronization compared to the traditional synchronized keyword. Locks allow more control over synchronization, including try-lock mechanisms, interruptible locks, and conditions for thread coordination.

###Key Methods in the Lock Interface
* void lock()
Acquires the lock. If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread waits until the lock is available.

* void lockInterruptibly()
Acquires the lock unless the current thread is interrupted. This method allows the lock acquisition to be responsive to thread interruptions.

* boolean tryLock()
Attempts to acquire the lock without waiting. Returns true if the lock was acquired, and false otherwise.

* boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)
Attempts to acquire the lock within a specified waiting time. If the lock is not available, the thread waits for the specified time before giving up.

* void unlock()
Releases the lock. Itâ€™s essential to call this in a finally block to ensure the lock is always released.

* Condition newCondition()
Returns a Condition object for the lock, which can be used for thread communication (like wait(), notify() in synchronized blocks).

## ReentrantLock
The source code for the ReentrantLock class is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK). Below is a simplified and annotated version of the key components in java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock, focusing on its main functionality.

###Key Components of ReentrantLock
The ReentrantLock class internally uses an instance of AbstractQueuedSynchronizer (AQS) to manage synchronization. AQS is a framework for implementing blocking locks and related synchronizers.

####Key Points
####AbstractQueuedSynchronizer (AQS):
The core framework used by ReentrantLock to manage the lock state and thread queuing.

#####Fair vs. Non-Fair Locking:

#####Fair: 
Threads are granted access in the order they request it.
#####Non-Fair: 
Threads can "cut the line," leading to potential performance benefits but less fairness.
#####Reentrancy:
The lock supports reentrancy, allowing the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times.

#####Conditions:
newCondition() provides a Condition object for finer control over thread communication.
