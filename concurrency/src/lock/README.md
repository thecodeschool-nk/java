In Java, the Lock interface is part of the java.util.concurrent.locks package and provides a more flexible mechanism for thread synchronization compared to the traditional synchronized keyword. Locks allow more control over synchronization, including try-lock mechanisms, interruptible locks, and conditions for thread coordination.

Key Methods in the Lock Interface
void lock()
Acquires the lock. If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread waits until the lock is available.

void lockInterruptibly()
Acquires the lock unless the current thread is interrupted. This method allows the lock acquisition to be responsive to thread interruptions.

boolean tryLock()
Attempts to acquire the lock without waiting. Returns true if the lock was acquired, and false otherwise.

boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)
Attempts to acquire the lock within a specified waiting time. If the lock is not available, the thread waits for the specified time before giving up.

void unlock()
Releases the lock. Itâ€™s essential to call this in a finally block to ensure the lock is always released.

Condition newCondition()
Returns a Condition object for the lock, which can be used for thread communication (like wait(), notify() in synchronized blocks).
